Definition: 
  - A forward start option is an exotic option that is purchased and paid for now but becomes active later with a strike price determined at that time. The     activation date, expiration date, and underlying asset are fixed at the time of purchase.
The contract typically stipulates some parameters for where the strike price will be in relation to the underlying asset's price. For example, the people buying/selling the option could specify that the strike will be at the money (ATM) at activation, or 3% or 5% in the money or out of the money (OTM).
